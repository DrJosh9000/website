[Version 2.2.0](https://github.com/google/periph/releases/tag/v2.2.0) is
released!

This is a polish and features update. I know a [v3 was
promised](/news/2017/towards_v3/) but we decided to punt on breaking changes
since there was too much great stuff to bake into the v2 branch.

Historical note: periphextra and hostextra.Init() is deprecated.

## Hardware support

- [beagle](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/beagle): Full header support for the
  BeagleBone Black and Green. Common headers are in
  [bone](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/beagle/bone).
- [rpi](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/rpi): Correctly handles the RPi3 B+
  model.
- [bcm283x](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x): Added new functions to
  read or modifying 32 GPIOs all at once;
  [PinsRead0To31()](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x#PinsRead0To31),
  [PinsClear0To31()](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x#PinsClear0To31) and
  [PinsSet0To31()](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x#PinsSet0To31).
- [bcm283x](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x): Improved DMA support.
  - **Warning**: Still experimental.
- New [experimental device
	drivers](https://github.com/google/periph/tree/v2.2.0/experimental/devices)
	were contributed:
  [cap1188](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/cap1188),
  [hd44780u](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/hd44780),
  [mfrc522](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/mfrc522).


## Software

- [gpioreg](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpioreg): The GPIO registry had
  intensive structural changes in preparation for support of dynamic GPIOs, e.g.
  over USB. It completely discarded the principle of pin numbers, and only
  refers to pin names. Number-based aliases are still kept, but they need to be
  the decimal textural string representation. Added Unregister.
  - **Warning**: The primary side effect is that alias evaluation via
    [gpio.RealPin](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio#RealPin) may have to be
    done in places where it 'happened to work' previously.
- [conn](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn): Removed a ton of indirect
  dependencies on [reflect](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/). This is to make
  conn essentially 'reflect-free', which would enable more embedded uses cases.
- Added `String()` to all objects, in preparation to requiring it in
  [conn.Resource](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn#Resource).
- Refactored *all examples* to be copy-pastable.
- [periph](https://periph.io/x/periph): Added undocumented support for a new
  method `After()`, which [enables significantly more
  parallelism](https://twitter.com/periphio/status/986235606803124224) in driver
  loading. This function will be added to
  [periph.Driver](https://periph.io/x/periph#Driver) in v3.
- [cmd](https://periph.io/x/periph/cmd/): Added support for a new build tag
  `periphextra`. This makes the executables use
  [hostextra.Init()](https://periph.io/x/extra/hostextra#Init) instead of
  [host.Init()](https://periph.io/x/periph/host#Init).
  - **Warning**: If you use a pattern like `go build ./cmd/periph-info/main.go`,
    this will not work anymore as
    each executable is now multiple source files. The correct way is `go install
    periph.io/x/periph/cmd/periph-info`
- [gpiotest](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiotest): Added
  [PinPWM](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiotest#PinPWM) and
  [LogPinIO](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiotest#LogPinIO).
- [onewire-list](https://periph.io/x/periph/cmd/onewire-list) to display
  registered 1-wire buses.

[Version 3.2.0](https://github.com/google/periph/releases/tag/v3.2.0) is
released! A lot of things improved in the past 4 months.

This is a feature and bug fix update. Highlights are:

- Lots of new physics types.
- Adds support for Allwinner A20 and MIPS.
- Standardizes pin functionality names.

diff stat of ` 123 files changed, 5958 insertions(+), 1395 deletions(-)`.


## New packages

- [i2s](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/i2s): add pin.Func functionality names.
- [jtag](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/jtag): add pin.Func functionality
  names.
- [uart](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/uart): add pin.Func functionality
  names.
- [cap1xxx](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/cap1xxx): was promoted from
  experimental. This device enables capacitive touch sensing.


## Improvements

- [headers-list](https://periph.io/x/periph/cmd/headers-list) and
  [gpio-list](https://periph.io/x/periph/cmd/gpio-list): print alternate pin
  functions, which is super rad.
- [gpio](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio): add pin.Func constants.
- [pin](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/pin): add PinFunc interface to enable
  changing the pin functionality to alternate modes at runtime. It is now
  supported by all drivers implementing PinIO.
- [gpiostreamtest](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/gpiostreamtest):
  correctly implement conn.Resource.
- [mmr](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/mmr): implements conn.Conn.
- [physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic): added more units: Angle,
  ElectricalCapacitance, Energy, LuminousFlux, LuminousIntensity, Power.
  Documentation improvements.
- [physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic): fixed rounding for String()
  methods.
- [ssd1306](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/ssd1306): added option to
  customize the hardware pin layout.
- [allwinner](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/allwinner): added support for the
  A20.
- [bcm283x](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x): got improvements for PWM
  support, still needs more work.
- [rpi](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/rpi): added Compute Module 3 pin
  headers.
- [sysfs](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs): improve resilience of edge
  detection against poorly implemented gpio drivers.
- MIPS is now supported. Includes experimental driver for mt7688.
- Improvements to experimental drivers bitbang and nrzled.

## Improvements

Improvements done in the past month:

- [apa102](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/apa102) got support to disable the
  global PWM and new variables
  [NeutralTemp](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/apa102#NeutralTemp),
  [PassThruOpts](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/apa102#PassThruOpts) to
  simplify disabling color temperature correction.
- [bmxx80](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/bmxx80) had a regression in v3.0.0
  in humidity measurement on the BME280 fixed.
- Experimental drivers
  [unicornhd](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/unicornhd),
  [mpu9250](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/mpu9250) and
  command [periph-web](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/cmd/periph-web)
  were added.
- Various documentation improvements.
- [pinreg](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/pin/pinreg) added
  [Unregister()](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/pin/pinreg#Unregister). It's
  be needed to support unplugging headers exposed via USB.

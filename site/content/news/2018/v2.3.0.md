[Version 2.3.0](https://github.com/google/periph/releases/tag/v2.3.0) is
released!

This is a feature and user improvement update with new packages in preparation
for v3. This is the last v2 release (for real!). As of now, the `v3` branch has
been merged into `master` so if you `go get` periph, you _will_ get the v3
changes, not v2.3.0.

<!--more-->

The new release contains [34
changes](https://github.com/google/periph/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0) for a diff
stat of `72 files changed, 3043 insertions(+), 742 deletions(-)`.


## New packages for v3

Two new packages were added right away to reduce the delta with v3:

- [image14bit](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/lepton/image14bit): added in
  preparation for [lepton](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/lepton) v3
  changes.
- [physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic): new package with fixed
  point units to represent the physical world. It replaces the units that were
  defined in package [devices](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices) in v2.


## Improvements

A slew of improvements were done in the past month:

- [allwinner](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/allwinner) and
  [bcm283x](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x): add automatic fallback to
  sysfs GPIO if the CPU driver failed to load. This means users can still use
  these Pin definition even if only sysfs access is available.
- chip, pine64, odroid, rpi: Made the header drivers load even if the CPU driver
  failed, so the headers are defined, and will fallback to sysfs GPIO if needed.
- [bcm283x](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x): added PinsSetup0To27(),
  Drive(), SlewLimit() and Hysteresis().
- [sysfs](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs): performance improvements in
  I2C and SPI by removing memory allocation in the common path.
- [apa102](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/apa102): removed memory
  allocation in Halt().
- [bmxx80](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/bmxx80): added benchmarks to
  compare the different calibration function implementations.
- Added more GPIO benchmarks, yet accelerated gohci cycle time by skipping
  partially redundant ones.
- Fixed Kelvin to not use the Â° symbol.
- Internal refactoring to help maintenance.


## Special thanks

Thanks to [Menno](https://github.com/mjs) for help with Lepton design
improvements and contribution of the image14bit package

I ([@maruel](https://github.com/maruel)) did the rest, including the release
process and the [gohci test lab](https://github.com/periph/gohci).

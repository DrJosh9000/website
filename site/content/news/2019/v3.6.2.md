[Version 3.6.2](https://github.com/google/periph/releases/tag/v3.6.2) is
released!

It turns out that adding a go.mod files in v3.5.0 wasn't a good idea without
completely converting to go modules. This fixes go module users that weren't
able to update past v3.4.0. We may add go.mod back in v4.0.0.

See the [commit
description](https://github.com/google/periph/commit/8dc522fd6d6756e1ee5f72c23f05a06a6382776c)
for the gory details.

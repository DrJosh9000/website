[Version 2.1.0](https://github.com/google/periph/releases/tag/v2.1.0) is
released!

This is a polish, features and performance update. It includes a **25x** (!)
GPIO performance improvements, a nice slew of new features and no breaking
change.

## New features

This release brings a whole set of new features:

- [allwinner]( https://periph.io/x/periph/host/allwinner/#Pin.FastOut) and
  [bcm238x]( https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x/#Pin.FastOut): Added
  `Pin.FastOut()` for ultra high performance.
  - gpio: Increased I/O performance by up to 25x. üèé See the [dedicated blog post
    describing how this was done](/news/2017/gpio_perf/).
- gpio: `Halt()` has been consistently added to all concrete types implementing
  [gpio.PinIO](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio#PinIO).
   - On the next major version, Halt() will be added to the interface. Tracked
     as issue [#183](https://github.com/google/periph/issues/183).
- [bcm283x](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x/): Added
  [PWM()](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x/#Pin.PWM) ‚éç‚éç‚éç‚éç support.
  - Added a new driver `bcm283x-dma` to implement hardware PWM support and
    [ReadTime()](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x#ReadTime) for a stable
    clock with 1¬µs resolution.
- [conn](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/): Added
  [Resource](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/#Resource).
  - It will supersede [devices.Device](
    https://periph.io/x/periph/devices#Device) on the next major version.
    Tracked as issue [#184](https://github.com/google/periph/issues/184).
- [gpiostream](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/): Added
  [BitsLSB](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/#BitsLSB),
  [BitsMSB](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/#BitsMSB),
  [BitStreamLSB](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/#BitStreamLSB)
  and [BitStreamMSB](
  https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/#BitStreamMSB) to support both
  byte endianness.
  - [Bits](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/#Bits) and
    [BitStream](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/#BitStream) will
    be removed in the next major version. Tracked as issue [#189](
    https://github.com/google/periph/issues/189).
- [gpiostream](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/): Added
  [PinIn](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/#PinIn) and
  [PinOut](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream/#PinOut) in
  preparation of streaming support.
- [sysfs](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs/): Changed [Pin.Function()](
  https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs/#Pin.Function), [.Read()](
  https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs/#Pin.Read) and [.Out()](
  https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs/#Pin.Out) so they do not make heap
  allocation anymore, to not cause heap fragmentation.

## Testing improvements

- Added GPIO benchmarks. See the [dedicated blog post describing the
  benchmarks](/news/2017/gpio_perf/).
  - The benchmarks enforce that no heap allocation occurs in core functions.
- [periph-smoketest](https://github.com/google/periph/tree/v2.1.0/cmd/periph-smoketest)
  overhaul to increase usability.
  - The command line argument for smoke test `gpio` changed to be consistent
    with the others.
- Made `go test` compatible with go 1.10beta1.
